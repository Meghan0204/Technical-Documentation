# Technical Documentation Page

A responsive technical documentation web page created as part of my web development projects. This page demonstrates structuring technical content with semantic HTML and styling it with custom CSS for readability and usability.

## Overview

This repository contains the source files for a technical documentation page that organizes information into clear sections with navigation. The project highlights the use of HTML for content structure and CSS for styling and responsive design. It mirrors professional documentation layouts commonly used for APIs, libraries, products, or internal engineering guides.

## Features

✔ Fixed navigation sidebar for quick section access  
✔ Clearly separated content sections with headings and paragraphs  
✔ Responsive layout that adapts to different screens  
✔ Semantic HTML for accessibility and structure

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for document structure and semantic content  
- **CSS3** – for layout, styling, and responsive design

---

## How It Works

- **`index.html`** defines the main content and section anchors.  
- A **navigation sidebar** lets users jump directly to specific parts of the documentation.  
- **`styles.css`** contains styles that control typography, spacing, and layout, making the documentation readable across device sizes.  
- The page uses CSS layout techniques (like flexbox or grid) to organize the sidebar and main content area cleanly.

This project demonstrates best practices in structuring and styling web content intended for informational or reference purposes.
